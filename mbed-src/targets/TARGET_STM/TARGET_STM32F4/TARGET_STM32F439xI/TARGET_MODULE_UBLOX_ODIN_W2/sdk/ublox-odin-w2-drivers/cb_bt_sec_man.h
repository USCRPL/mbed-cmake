/**
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_1_DISABLED
 * Security disabled
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Auto accept (No man-in-the-middle attack protection, encryption enabled) 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Authentication and encryption disabled. 
 * - Bluetooth Low Energy: Auto accept (No man-in-the-middle attack protection, encryption enabled) 
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_2_BT_2_0
 * - Enforce BT 2.0 (Service level authentication and encryption enabled) 
 * Please note that the device is not BT 2.1 qualified for this setting. It is included for backward compatibility. Invalid for Bluetooth Low Energy.
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_3_FIXED_PIN
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. 
 * - Bluetooth Low Energy: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. 
 * Please note that this security mode will not work with a general BT 2.1 device. However, it will work between two connectBlue BT 2.1 Serial Port Adapters. Use security mode 4 to make the device work with a general BT 2.1 device. 
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_4_JUST_WORKS
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Auto accept (no man-in-the-middle attack protection, encryption enabled) 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. 
 * - Bluetooth Low Energy: Auto accept (no man-in-the-middle attack protection, encryption enabled)
 * This security mode is intended for pairing in safe environments. When this mode is set, pairability (see AT*AGPM) is automatically disabled. In data mode, pairing can be enabled for 60 seconds by pressing the "External Connect" button for at least 5 seconds. When the module is pairable, the LED will blink. If the mode is changed from Just Works to another, pairability must be enabled again using the AT*AGPM command. 
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_5_DISPLAY_ONLY 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. User should be presented a passkey. 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. No user interaction required. 
 * - Bluetooth Low Energy: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. User should be presented a passkey.
 * This security mode is used when the device has a display that can present a 6-digit value that the user shall enter on the remote device. 
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_6_DISPLAY_YES_NO 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. User should compare two values. 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. No user interaction required. 
 * This security mode is used when the device has a display that can present a 6-digit value that the user shall verify with yes or no to the remote device's presented value. 
 * Invalid for Bluetooth Low Energy.
 * 
 * cbBSM_SECURITY_MODE_7_KEYBOARD_ONLY
 * - Remote Device BT 2.1: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. User should enter a passkey. 
 * - Remote Device BT 2.0: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. No user interaction required. 
 * - Bluetooth Low Energy: Service level authentication and encryption enabled. User should enter a passkey.
 * This security mode is used when the device only has a keyboard where the user can enter a 6-digit value that is presented on the remote device.
