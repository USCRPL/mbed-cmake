;;  TMPM3H6FWFG scatter file

;;  Vector table starts at 0
;;    Initial SP == |Image$$ARM_LIB_STACK$$ZI$$Limit| (for two region model)
;;               or |Image$$ARM_LIB_STACKHEAP$$ZI$$Limit| (for one region model)
;;    Initial PC == &__main (with LSB set to indicate Thumb)
;;    These two values are provided by the library
;;    Other vectors must be provided by the user
;;  Code starts after the last possible vector
;;  Data starts at 0x20000000
;;    Heap is positioned by ARM_LIB_HEAB (this is the heap managed by the ARM libraries)
;;    Stack is positioned by ARM_LIB_STACK (library will use this to set SP - see above)
