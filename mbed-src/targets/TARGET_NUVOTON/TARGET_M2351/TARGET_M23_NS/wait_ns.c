/* Override wait_ns to provide more accurate implementation
 *
 * At high HCLK rate, M2351 cannot provide zero-wait-state flash performance. Besides,
 * cache is off for non-secure land (for internal reason). To fix it, borrowing from
 * mbed-os/platform/mbed_wait_api_no_rtos.c wait_ns, we locate 'delay_loop_code' from
 * flash to SRAM to achieve zero-wait-state performance.
 *
 * NOTE1: With MPU, RAM is marked non-executable. We must mark RAM executable for
 *        running 'delay_loop_code' in SRAM.
 * NOTE2: Cache is on for secure land. This override is necessary only for non-secure
 *        land.
