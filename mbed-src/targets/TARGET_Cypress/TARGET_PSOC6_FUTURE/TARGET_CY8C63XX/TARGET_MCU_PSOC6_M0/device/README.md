README for Cypress Peripheral Driver Library
============================================

This folder tree contains parts (binary-only libraries and M0/M4 core specific files) of Cypress Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) necessary to support PSoC 6 MCUs. Library names have been changed (vs. standard PDL version) by prepending a "lib" prefix to fit Mbed OS build system conventions.
See [Cypress PDL page](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/peripheral-driver-library-pdl) for details.
